Hello, my name is Johannes, im 22 years old.

Im currently studying Computer Science with a main focus on Software-Engineering and Development.
I like to work with embedded systems like Arduinos, but im also interrested in Machine Learning and Video-Games (Not only playing them but also making them).

Currently i am trying to get into modding my favourite videogame, Factorio.
But i also have a lot of other [great and or maybe stupid Ideas](./Ideas.md) i want to make in the future.
